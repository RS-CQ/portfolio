- Engineer's degree in Digital System Engineering, (_June 2020_)
-[ENSEM](https://ensem.univ-lorraine.fr/), University of Lorraineï¼š Ranking 2/29 (2nd yr), 2/31	(3rd yr)				       		

- M.S. in Network Security and Virtual Architecture, (_June 2020_), dual degrees with Engineer's degree, University of Lorraine 	


## Research interests
My research interests lie in the trustworthiness and reliability of cyber-physic systems (CPS). In particular, my current research focuses on 1)security and resilient trust-based systems in the 
service-oriented Internet of Things, and 2) Quality of Service (QoS)-focused performance evaluation in 5G-enabled Internet of Vehicles.
