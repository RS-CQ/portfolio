## Research interests
My research interests lie in the trustworthiness and reliability of cyber-physic systems (CPS). In particular, my current research focuses on 1)security and resilient trust-based systems in the 
service-oriented Internet of Things, and 2) Quality of Service (QoS)-focused performance evaluation in 5G-enabled Internet of Vehicles.
